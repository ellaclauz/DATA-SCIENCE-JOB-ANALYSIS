# DATA-SCIENCE-JOB-ANALYSIS
This is a PowerBi visualization project

In this data science job analysis dashboard, I provided insights on:
* The country with the highest number of data science job companies and the highest number of employees.
* The highest paid job title.
* The total, average, maximum and minimum salaries of data science jobs
* The most in demand job title.
* The year with the highest number of remote workers.
